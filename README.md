# Image-Processing-
CS203 Course Project using verilog
In this project we have implemented image processing in verilog.

1. We use PIL library in python to convert any image into its hex file.

2.  We use the hex file generated in 1 to process the hex file in verilog.

3. We output the processed pixels in 2 as another hex file.

4. We use PIL library in python to convert any hex file generated in 3 into a image in png format.
